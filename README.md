  ## Description
  This project is continuation of developing my personal portfolio website that I created in the past. <br>
  I have updated my linkedin, github, and resume and linked these back into the portfolio so that my potential employer <br>
  can have better access to explore my information and work. I have attached 2 of my previous homework as well as my first team project.
